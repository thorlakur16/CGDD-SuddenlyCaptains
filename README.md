# SuddenlyCaptains

This is a two player co-op game made in the three week course Computer Game Design & Development in Reykjavík University.

Two janitors are left on a spaceship after they were left cleaning the toilets when a party was going on upstairs in the bridge of the ship. Suddenly the bridge explodes and all the crew dies, except the two janitors. Now they have to team up to land the ship together.

The goal of the game is to land the spaceship safely with your friend. Interact with the different terminals to turn on the boosters and look out for the landing gear terminal, when it lits up you can put the landing gear down which is crucial for landing.
